The past week was full of emotions.I’ve got two emails , one stating that WITx learning Program is gonna wind up this week and then second , regarding my chatbot that I have submitted the previous week.

The former email , left me surprised as well as shocked .The task for this week was #apply , which is to apply for GHCI scholarship sponsored by Muthoot foundation.For this scholarship 5 girls from our program would get selected to attend GHCI going to be held at Bangalore.Now , this was quite a surprise for me, for the dates of the conference were too close and providing a scholarship at this time was something I couldn’t even think of.Moreover, getting a chance to apply for this , is something that I’ve longed for, regardless of the results.

Through this email, Arya told that its gonna be the last week of the program , and I am pretty sure I am gonna miss my life as a WITx participant.This program has left me with so many resources , helped me build an online profile and have also made me more confident than ever before.The fun part was answering all those interesting questions they have asked in the application form of the GHCI scholarship.

From a person , who was afraid to even think about answering such deep questions , I have changed to a person who now loves to answer such questions as asked in the Scholarship form.Peeps, we need to ask ourselves such questions , frame answers for it and we will end up with new perspectives and ideas.

My favourite question was regarding bubbles ,

“Right now, as you fill this form, do you feel that you might not get selected to the scholarship? Is your brain is telling you — To receive the scholarship you should have been a class topper, published research papers, done lot of projects or speak fluent, flowery english? How does an ideal WITx scholarship winner look like in your head? Let’s call her bubbles. Introduce us to your bubbles :) Tell us about her characteristics.”

Think over the question .I am pretty sure everyone will have different answers and do think about “Why cant you be your bubbles?what is it that is stopping you from atleast trying to be your bubbles?”

And we created our avatar of bubbles.Here’s mine ;)

Also, in the mail there was a guidance regarding how to apply for the opportunites .Attaching the link here (do check it out , its really useful).

Coming to the email regarding the chatbot , guess what !!My chatbot got approved for production and that too in the first try!!Here’s a screenshot of what I had received.

check out my bot here: [ACM SRC](https://sites.google.com/view/acmsrc/home)

Luckily , my bot could be used for the website building competiton as part of ACM student chapter of TKMCE , since I had taken an opportunity related to ACM.

In between all this , I was able to learn a bit of photoshop(to create the gratitude poster as part of the scholarship application)as well as develop my skills in django during this week.This week ,indeed, turned out to be productive for me.Throughout this program , I was able to stay productive without compensating academics.Though the program has ended, I’ll continue to push my limits for I have seen how far I can go and I have envisioned how far I can get!!
