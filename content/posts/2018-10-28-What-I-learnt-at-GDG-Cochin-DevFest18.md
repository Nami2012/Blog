GDG DevFest18 was one of the most awaited event for me. Having got a ticket for it when I thought I won’t get it, doubled up my happiness and excitement. And it was indeed worth it.

The event started on time, and the place was filled with people who were curious, excited and energetic and had a passion for learning. People who are on the way to becoming a developer and who were already one, because they had a passion. The type of people who think and ask, not the ones who never .Being able to share a venue with them itself was amazing.

The morning session started off with a talk by Mr. Amrit Sanjeev ‘on device machine learning’. One of the best talks ever had, where the audience was able to connect with the speaker and also able to understand whatever he says.

The best thing Amrit had said was a reply to a question that one of the students raised was ‘Engineering matters!!’. When everyone was having opinions that the education system is outdated, his words were on the other extreme. Jumping into machine learning and starting off building application is never the right way unless you learn a little bit of basic concepts and theory. Unless you have the foundation set right, you can’t build higher levels. People find Google’s interviews difficult, not because the questions are difficult but rather because the questions were asked differently, i.e. the basics.

Then came a talk by Mr. Dilip Thomas, an ex computer scientist with Adobe, and currently a freelancing consultant on deep learning and computer vision. This was where I thought initially as a person who doesn’t know much about deep learning. Other than what it is, his talk would be one I won’t be able to understand much. But things turned out the other way round. This was a talk where ideas sparked within me and I was able to enjoy the most as a starter. A talk about how deep learning can be used for object identification with 99% accuracy, how this can be used to create a high resolution image given a low resolution one: how an image can be recreated and why it will be able to perform better than the human eye was something which induced curiosity and the urge to know more about the subject.

Two Talks were over, one left. I was glad that I came to DevFest’18 even though I had regular class in my college on that day. The third talk proved to be even more worthy, making people think even more on a higher level. It was a talk by Mr. Faris Rahman, one of the top contributors at keras in the world on ‘deep learning is not enough.’ Our end game is focusing on artificial general intelligence and for that deep learning is not enough.

After all this talks, we had an icebreaker, a different type of quiz which each and every person can indulge in using kahoot.com.

The afternoon session consisted of hands on session on introduction of Google assistant chatbot and dialogue flow by Gopi Krishnan and Farha Kareem . Having successfully failed in creating a bot earlier for a project,through this lively session I was able to make a simple chatbot . It was a wonderful session with brainstorming where we were asked to create our own simple bot.

Though I have attended similar events in the past, GDG DevFest appeared to be well organized, well structured and something that all the participants can thoroughly enjoy irrespective of what knowledge they have in that field. They just need to have the drive and a mind to learn. When we find and be with people similar to you, it’s pure bliss.

So what I learnt at GDG DevFest, have the drive to learn, and do what you love to do plus the beautiful words ‘Engineering Matters!!’.
