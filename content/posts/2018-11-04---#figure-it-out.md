Life is different when you are a participant of WITx learning program.You have exciting tasks to do that too within a limited time, and that deadline is exactly the time required for the work to be done .

So This week , we were asked to choose a unique opportunity and build a chatbot that gives information regarding the opportunity we have chosen.Choosing a unique opportunity seemed to be initially difficult, as each of 70 girls need to have unique opportunity, but it was fun too.The first 3 opportunities I chose got overlapped with the previously chosen ones, and finally I was able to stick with ACM Student Research Competition.Though I had a superactive ACM Chapter at my college , it was only when I kept searching for more opportunities I came to know that such an opportunity existed.

Creating a chatbot within a week , indeed seemed to be impossible at first, but then when I started working on it ,it was pretty simple.Thanks to Farha Kareem’s and Gopi Krishnan’s Hands on session on ‘actions on google’ at GDG Cochin Devfest’18 , and Systers workshop on the same led by Mandy Chan , I was able to build a simple chatbot for guiding students to participate for ACM SRC.It is currently under Review for release.

Apart from this,last week Arya Came live and gave feedback on our last week’s #connect activity.she gave an insight on what all mistakes the participants have done and suggested on where we all can improve.

Also we had an open house session with Dhanya Sreekumar , one of the WITx program guide , and WIT Cohort 1 participant.It was a really cool session wherein she pointed out areas where we might make mistakes while making a chatbot and also suggested to check out Rethink Credo. Do check it out if you haven’t, because it is worth our time.

Over the past week , I have realised that we will be making time for what is important for us.And that Nothing makes a person more productive than the last minute. Can’t wait for the next WITx activity!!
