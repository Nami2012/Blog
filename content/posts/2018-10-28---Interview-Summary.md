As a part of the #connect activity of the WITx learning program , we were asked to go through the interview done by WIT cohort 1 participants.The interview done by Bhairavi Shah with Ivana Irene Thomas , grabbed my attention.

Ivana Irene Thomas is a 2018 GHC scholar, and in the interview , she explained about her interests , her journey as a GHC scholar, described about the GHC event , and how she prepared to apply for the event.And I find her to be having a cool personality , and is able to connect with the interviewer easily.She also is a very humble person , and has a passion for front end development which is clearly visible in her website and her resume.

I got a clear insight on what is GHC scholarship and how to apply for it.And what I found to be the most important are :

* Find out more opportunities .subscribe to various newsletters , know what is going around.

* Start early for whatever you are preparing.Start building up your resume.
* Show your passion through the resume .
* Be active in the STEM clubs at the school or college level.
* Your teacher can be of great help to you.
* And last, TRY , dont feel low by looking at the achievements of other people.

I am glad that I viewed this interview , because now I have a vision on how to move forward.This activity was really interesting and helpful to us.
