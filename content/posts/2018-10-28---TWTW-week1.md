Same day over and over.Checking emails multiple times during class to see if something interesting has come up.Everyday , I was receiving only newsletters.But then on Oct 25 , I got a mail from the WITx program team telling that I have got selected for the WITx learning program.I was excited about the whole thing.

We were to be given a set of activities as part of the program , and the first one was #discover.Each of the 70 participants were able to discover and tweet 3 opportunities , that too within 15 minutes.I had realised that there are a lot of opportunities lying ahead and we are not aware of.An excel sheet is going to be made , listing all these opportunities so that people could know about it.

Then came the #connect .we were asked to view an interview by particpants of cohort 1 and write a summary for it.I chose the interview of Ivana Irene Thomas done by Bhairavi Shah , because Ivana was a former GHC scholar and I am interested in GHC.

I am glad that I decided to apply for the WITx program, for now I have a website of my own , a introductory video about me, an active twitter account( I got interested in tweeting after my first tweet for the #discover activity) , and an insight on how to have a proper application for GHC, everything within a week.

Looking forward for what is going to be the next task!!
