Its the third week of November and you have exams nearing.And when you have exams ahead, you have to stay in the box,i.e you wont have much time to learn about things outside of your syllabus.Past week was such a week, yet its during that phase when life gives you experience and lessons.

The week of November 12–18 was the week filled up with both rejections and acceptance.I was a bit dejected to know that I didn’t get selected for WITx- Muthoot GHCI scholarship but Arya’s mail made it up to take up #100rejectionschallenge.A simple challenge which enables us to take rejections lightly.Its only when you get rejected many times , you lose the fear of rejection and start applying!!.

Adding #3 to the rejections list:MIT Bootcamps.MIT Bootcamps was itself a huge event which was difficult to get selected.But what made me apply for it is the application process.They had asking some really interesting questions and a video , and after doing a lot of videos for applications now, it has become a piece of cake!

Adding to #5 to the acceptance list : GitHub Campus Expert Training Program.The acceptance was completely unexpected.

With lab exams happening and series exams coming up , I was on a tight schedule.But then I’ve realised that you make time up for things you are really interested in.This weekend , I had a heck lot to study, but kept that all aside for going to ACM TKMCE Chapter’s social programme to teach computer to underprivileged children.It turned out to be really cool where I was able to interact with children and share my knowledge with them!!
