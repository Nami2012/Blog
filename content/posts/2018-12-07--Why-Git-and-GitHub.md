Git and GitHub(make the H capital always!! :P) have become so common in the world of engineering that most of us find it cool and inevitable.Yet there are many others who have just heard about it, not knowing its importance.For ordinary people its just a random cat,but for those who use GitHub ,It is a SUPERCAT!!

The First time I heard GitHub , was before I joined Engineering(about 1 year ago) and thought this cat thingy won’t be of much use.Moreover , I struggled to use it back then.The question that always arose in my mind was “Why should I learn Git and GitHub?”.Here’s what I found to be its answer after learning Git and GitHub.

# Why Git : save your work always!!

Git is a version control system.And that means a system to keep track of all the changes that you have made to your file(or rather folder).It saves all your work , and enables access to any stage of your project at any time.This means you can avoid scenarios like this:

One can move back into the history of the project , undo and redo changes with the introduction of Git.

Git can also be used to find changes between two files, find out what extra feature has been added to your newly saved Repository(project folder in GIT language).

Also , it enables one experiment with the project code keeping the original project intact.One could try adding a new feature and if its not working she could switch back to that stage of the project without the feature.

In other words, Git marks down what change has occurred to your project at what point of time, enabling people to change their code, experiment and also makes it easier to find bugs in the code.

what more reason do we as engineers need to use Git!!

# Why GitHub:Collaborate

GitHub is an online hosting service so as to host your repositories(your project files/folder).It enables you to save your projects files online so that your friends or acquaintance or your teammate can collaborate with you for your project.This makes it easier to find and fix bugs as well as expand or scale up the project.
STOP PROCRASTINATING AND START CONTRIBUTING ;)

Git and GitHub has changed the face of opensource softwares .Using these tools contributing to open source has become a piece of cake.Anyone can suggest changes to opensource projects and softwaresas well as make your opensource your project.A lot of open source programs like GSOC, GSSOC,RGSOC etc…are now possible with Git ,GitHub and GitLab.

# The GREEN era!

The more you contribute , the more your activity table becomes green.The intensity of green conveys the intensity of your contribution.(TOP SECRET: heard companies are hiring based on your GitHub profile and contribution activity;) )

# Complex is simple!

As I’ve said earlier ,Learning Git and GitHub can seem to be one hell of a task, but once you learn it , your other tasks become easy!!There are so many new terms (repository, commits,, pull requests, master branch ,rebase etc..) that leaves you confused , but learn it soon and you won’t regret it!!

Here are some cool resources where you can learn Git and GitHub:

[Learn Git Branching: An interactive Git visualization tool to educate and challenge!](learngitbranching.js.org)

[Udacity online course to learn Git and GitHub.](classroom.udacity.com)


See you in GitHub!!
